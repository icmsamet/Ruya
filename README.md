# Ruya

April - 2021

"Ruya" was made on “GAMEHIGHED Jam 2021”, my first 72 hour Gamejam I attended. Theme” You only
live once.” At Gamejam, we talked about “the dream of a child who thinks his life is meaningless”.

There is an unhappy young man who treats the people and animals around him badly. In a dream he had one night, he tasted the happiness of being kind to those around him. When he woke up, he wouldn't be the same as before. He saw that once he came to life and lived this life for good purposes, what a unique life he had. It is a game in which you try to find the needs of a human or an animal that can be happy in your dream. At the same time, be careful, if you collect the others while collecting the desired need, you will lose points from the other two bars in your gaze. Come on, try our game. You will understand the importance of life.
